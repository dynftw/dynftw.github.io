		<h3>Version 2.8.0 (2016-05-22)</h3>
			Note: It is highly recommended to update to the latest version of LGS as it improves lighting performance<br>
			significantly. With the update, headset/mouse lighting no longer causes keyboard lighting to lag.<br><br>
			<ul>	
				<li>
					<u>HORIZONTAL COLOR WAVE EFFECT (HORIZONTAL RAINBOW)</u><br>
					Added a horizontal color wave effect that can be toggled under the new color mode "Horizontal Gradient".<br>
					The speed of the effect and the direction (left, right, center in and center out) can be set.<br>
					The spacing between each column of colors can also be selected.<br><br>
				</li>
				<li>
					<u>VERTICAL COLOR WAVE EFFECT (VERTICAL RAINBOW)</u><br>
					Added a vertical color wave effect that can be toggled.<br>
					The speed of the effect and the direction (up or down) can be set.<br>
					The spacing between each row of colors can also be selected.<br>
					ARX Support for the horizontal and vertical color wave effects will be added in a future update.<br><br>
				</li>
				<li>
					<u>RECORDING DEVICES CAN NOW BE USED AS THE INPUT DEVICE</u><br>
					Recording devices (such as microphones) can now be selected as the Input Device for the spectrogram.<br><br>
				</li>
				<li>
					<u>IMPROVED ERROR CATCHING FOR SPECTROGRAM</u><br>
					Added better error catching and more helpful error messages for spectrogram errors.<br><br>
				</li>
				<li>
					<u>HEADSET/MOUSE LIGHTING REFRESH RATE INCREASED</u><br>
					Headset/mouse lighting now refreshes at the same frequency as the keyboard lighting.<br><br>
				</li>
				<li>
					<u>BUG FIX</u><br>
					Fixed an issue where the program would freeze if the refresh delay was set to a very low value when the<br> 
					On-Screen Output window was open.<br>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<hr>
		<h3>Version 2.7.1 (2016-03-27)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<u>CONTROL SPECTROGRAM WITH MEDIA KEYS GLOBALLY</u><br>
					The spectrogram can now be started and stopped using the media keys on your keyboard (Play/Pause and Stop).<br>
					This feature now works even when the program is not in focus (eg. when in the background or minimised to tray).<br><br>
				</li>
				<li>
					<u>BUG FIX</u><br>
					The status bar now works again.<br><br>
				</li>
				<li>
					<u>BUG FIX</u><br>
					If an error occurs while loading settings at startup, the user will be given the option to:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Restore default settings and exit (a copy of the settings will be left in the settings folder).<br>
							This will allow the program to start normally the next time it is started.<br>
						</li>
						<li>
							Do nothing and exit.<br>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>Version 2.7.0 (2016-03-20)</h3>    
			<ul>
			   <li>
				   <u>REGIONAL KEYBOARD LAYOUTS</u><br>
				   Added an option to select keyboard layout.<br>
				   The available keyboard layouts are:<br>
					   Layout 1:	United States (US), Chinese (CHT)<br>
					   Layout 2:	International (INTL), German (DEU), Spanish (ESP), French (FRA), Italian (ITA), Nordic (NORDIC), Swedish (SW), Turkish (TUR), United Kingdom (UK)<br>
					   Layout 3:	Japanese (JPN)<br>
					   Layout 4:	Korean (KOR)<br>
					   Layout 5:	Russian (RU)<br><br>
			   </li>
			   <li>
				   <u>"EXTRA" REGIONAL KEYS NOW USED</u><br>
				   Spectrogram now uses the "extra" keys on regional keyboard layouts - be sure to select your keyboard layout in the settings.<br><br>
			   </li>
			   <li>
				   <u>CONTROL SPECTROGRAM WITH MEDIA KEYS</u><br>
				   The spectrogram can now be started and stopped using the media keys on your keyboard (Play/Pause and Stop).<br>
				   Note that this currently only works when the program is in focus. However, it can be changed to work globally if there is enough demand for it.<br><br>
			   </li>
			   <li>
				   <u>EASILY TRANSFER SETTINGS FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS</u><br>
				   When updating to a new version of the program, the user will be able to seamlessly import saved settings from any previous version.<br>
				   This will make it much easier to transfer user settings over to a new version.<br><br>
			   </li>
			   <li>
				   <u>AUTOMATIC UPDATE CHECKER</u><br>
				   The program automatically checks for updates on startup and displays an informative notification if an update is available.<br>
				   The user can also manually check for updates by clicking the button in the Settings tab. The update checker can be disabled if desired.<br><br>
			   </li>
			   <li>
				   <u>HEADSET/MOUSE LIGHTING REFRESH RATE REDUCED</u><br>
				   Headset/mouse lighting now refreshes half as frequently as the keyboard lighting. While this is not ideal, this lighting was causing the keyboard <br>
				   lighting to be noticeably less fluid and in certain cases, appear extremely laggy. The delay itself appears to be happening within LGS.<br><br>
			   </li>
			   <li>
				   <u>BUG FIX</u><br>
				   Fixed a bug where importing settings from version 2.5.0 and earlier would not work.<br><br>
			   </li>
			   <li>
				   <u>BUG FIX</u><br>
				   Fixed a bug where the program would not start if there were two (or more) playback devices with the same name.<br>
			   </li>
